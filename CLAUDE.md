# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Alex Alex is an open-source **narrative engine kernel** for long-form AI-assisted fiction writing. It's not a chatbot — it's a systems-engineering approach to maintaining character consistency, causal chain integrity, and foreshadowing closure across hundreds of thousands of words via structured narrative state management.

## Architecture: DDD Four-Layer

```
domain/           # Domain layer — zero external deps, pure business logic
  novel/          # Novel aggregate, Chapter entity, Storyline, Foreshadowing registry
  bible/          # Story Bible aggregate root (composes cast/worldbuilding/structure)
  cast/           # Character roster (ensemble-level view, distinct from per-character model)
  character/      # Character entity model (POV firewall, frequency scheduling)
  worldbuilding/  # World setting triples, locations, factions
  structure/      # Macro structure (part/volume/act/chapter scaffolding)

interfaces/       # Interface layer — external boundaries
  api/v1/         # Versioned REST API (FastAPI), split by subdomain:

```

## Engine Subsystems

Alex contains multiple specialized engines, each with a distinct role in the narrative production pipeline:

| Engine | Layer | Role |
|--------|-------|------|
| **Autopilot Daemon** | `application/engine/services/` | Staged state machine driving full-novel generation: macro planning → act beats → chapter loop → post-chapter pipeline. Circuit breaker, SSE streaming, checkpoint snapshots. |
| **DAG Engine** | `application/engine/dag/` | LangGraph-based DAG executor with topological parallel execution. Compiles `DAGDefinition` → `StateGraph`, supports checkpoint/resume. Nodes split by concern: planning, context, execution, review, validation, gateway, anti-AI, props, world. |
| **Narrative Engine** | `application/narrative_engine/` | Novelist-facing **BFF read surface**. Aggregates read models across all domains via `NarrativeLens` dimensions (manuscript, macrocosm, plot structure, time/revision, subtext, persona/voice, craft/quality, knowledge graph, automation, platform). Exposed via `/api/v1/narrative-engine/`. |
| **Evolution Engine** | `application/evolution/` + `domain/evolution/` | Tracks story-world state changes across chapters: character status (alive/dead/missing), item transfers, fact reveals, storyline progress, emotional residue. Gate validation ensures state transitions are narratively coherent. |
| **Governance Engine** | `application/governance/` | Enforces narrative contracts: canonical storylines with alias merging, forbidden early payoffs, reveal budgets, theme anchors. Produces `GovernanceReport` with severity-ranked issues. |
| **Memory Engine** | `application/memory/` + `domain/memory/` | Compiles character-specific context across chapters, projects character arcs forward, imports legacy memory formats. |
| **Chronicles (Codex)** | `application/codex/` | Dual-helix chronicles: zipper-merges plot timeline with semantic snapshots by chapter index for time/revision queries. |
| **Snapshot Manager** | `application/snapshot/` | Checkpoint creation, rollback, and HEAD tracking for the autopilot state machine. |

## Key Design Decisions

- **All SQLite writes** go through a single-writer dispatcher (`Write Dispatch`) to eliminate concurrent write conflicts
- **LLM providers** are abstracted behind a unified interface; switching models doesn't touch business code. Providers: Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible, Ark (Doubao), Gemini
- **Prompt strategy**: 20+ independent prompt injection points, each overridable via YAML config in `infrastructure/ai/prompt_packages/`
- **Vector retrieval**: Two parallel indexes — chapter content (ChromaDB / Qdrant) and knowledge triples (structured + semantic hybrid query)
- **Autopilot daemon** drives full-novel generation as a staged state machine with circuit breaker protection, checkpoint snapshots, and SSE real-time streaming
- **Bible composition**: `domain/bible/` is the aggregate root; `cast/`, `character/`, `worldbuilding/`, `structure/` are sub-aggregates broken out for independent evolution. Don't reach across them — go through the bible aggregate or an application service.
- **Engines vs. application services**: The "Engines" in the table above (Evolution, Governance, Memory, Codex, Snapshot) each have their own `application/<name>/` package with a clear public service; treat them as bounded contexts and avoid cross-importing internals.
- **Frontend** uses `@/` alias for `frontend/src/`; chunk splitting: naive-ui, echarts, vue-runtime, vendor. Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + Pinia + Vue Router + Vue Flow (DAG viz) + ECharts. Tauri 2.x for desktop builds.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure at minimum one LLM key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `ARK_API_KEY`). Key vars: `EMBEDDING_SERVICE` (openai/local), `VECTOR_STORE_TYPE` (chromadb), `LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_FILE`, `CORS_ORIGINS`, `DISABLE_AUTO_DAEMON`.

## Data

- SQLite DB: `data/plotpilot.db` (auto-created; falls back from old `aitext.db`)
- Vector store: `data/chromadb/`
- App logs: `logs/plotpilot.log`
- `.env` is gitignored; never commit secrets
